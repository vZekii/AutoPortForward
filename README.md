# AutoPortForward

A little script I wrote to go into my router settings to port forward for my minecraft server. My router uses DHCP and I can't find a setting for static IP so I overengineered this script to do it for me.

Unless you're using the same router as me it will not work, unless you make significant changes to the way it goes through menus and stuff. If you are trying to do so, good luck!
